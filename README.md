# Product-Card-Bootstrap-Version

# Project Description
This project was designed for a perfume company with the main purpose of showcasing my basic skills in responsive design using the Bootstrap component framework.

The project includes a parent container named 'Container,' and within it, there is a grid container named 'row.' The grid container has two columns, each spanning 6 columns from medium devices up to extra-extra-large (col-md-6). Consequently, they will span twelve columns on extra-small and small mobiles.

The font-family, font-size, and font weight used were 'Montserrat,' sans-serif; with values of 15px, 600, and 500, respectively. Some attributes were not documented in Bootstrap; nonetheless, I used custom CSS to customize them. Then, I assigned Bootstrap's documented attributes to control their behaviors.
